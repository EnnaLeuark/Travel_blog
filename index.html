        <h3 class="headings">The History of Travel</h3>
        <p class="mx-auto">
          <strong>TRAVEL</strong> dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks
          and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas
          in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae. While early travel tended to be
          slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration,
          cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to
          mean that travel has become easier and more accessible. Mankind has
          come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to
          the new world from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10
          weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century where
          aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.<br />
